## TP 1 Notes

(add your main observations/remarks about your experiments here, in a bulleted list, and remove this line. Some examples below)

- In exercise 1 we learned how to draw different shapes, starting with `MyTriangle` which took inspiration from `MyDiamond`, and then later drawing a parallelogram `MyParallelogram`. We also learned how to make these figures visible from both sides using `this.scene.gl.disable(this.scene.gl.CULL_FACE)`. Using checkboxes, we added in the option to show/hide each figure.
- In exercise 2 we took advantage of the previous code from the `MyTriangle` subclass to draw small and large triangles (`MyTriangleSmall` and `MyTriangleBig`).
